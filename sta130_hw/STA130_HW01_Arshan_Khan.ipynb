    "We explored how to find the number of rows and columns in your dataset using data.shape. It was mentioned that the dataset should have 391 rows and 11 columns (based on your execution).\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations vs. Variables:\n",
    "An observation is a row in the dataset (representing a villager), and a variable is a column (representing characteristics like species or personality).\n",
    "Attributes vs. Methods:\n",
    "An attribute (e.g., data.shape) returns stored information about the object.\n",
    "A method (e.g., data.describe()) performs some operation or calculation.\n",
    "Summarizing the Dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned how to summarize the dataset using functions like data.describe(), data.info(), and value_counts() for categorical columns.\n",
    "Methods to check for missing values in the dataset, including .isnull().sum() and .info() were also discussed.\n",
    "Understanding DataFrame Limits:\n",
    "\n",
    "We touched on the practical limits of pandas DataFrames in terms of rows and columns, with the main constraint being your system's available memory.\n",
    "Throughout the session, we focused on methods to understand and summarize your dataset efficiently using pandas in Python.\n",

Changing it to true will edit the dataframe permanently while keeping it at false will only show you the result of the changes for that once instance which may be more preferred if you do not want to directly edit the data. del df['col'] will completely delete any row and will always permanently delete the data as it lacks much functionality.\n",

Using df.dropna() to remove rows and columns with missing data first, then using del df['col'] to eliminate the rest of the unwanted data will be more efficient and quicker than only using one of the pieces of code. This is because df.dropna() has the capabilities to remove multiple rows and columns at once. Using df.dropna() can be beneficial before deleting columns as you can test to see how your data changes by leaving inplace as false.

It compares 2 columns and peforms some calculations about them. In this case, it groups the column 'survived' by each of it's different values, 1 and 0. Which will give it a different count showing how many times a 1 or 0 appears while the count value from df.describe() is the total number of data values in the survived column. df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe() will split the total count value up to provide information."
